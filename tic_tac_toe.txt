This code creates a simple Tic Tac Toe game app where two players (X and O) take turns to place their tokens
on a 3x3 board. The game is checked for the winner after each click, and if the match is won, a dialog box announcing 
the winner will be displayed. The game board can be restored after completing a match to start a new match.
